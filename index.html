  <h2 id="title"> Introduction</h2>
  <p id="text">Horror is a subgenre of film that has been creeping into the mainstream for quite some time. Horror has, historically, come in waves. With some examples being the universal monsters era of the 30s and 40s with films such as <i>Frankenstein</i> (1931 and <i>Dracula</i> (1931), the slasher boom of the 70s to 80s which saw movies such as <i>Halloween</i> (1978) and <i>Friday the 13th</i> (1980). Personally I believe the most important eras to examine are the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. Throughout these three decades, horror has repeatedly been seen in the spotlight and the evolution of the genre is more prevalent than ever. This page aims to provide brief information and a short overlook through each decade, highlighting some key works along the way.</p>
